        <h2>My Personal Anime Recommendation</h2>

            <span>July 3, 2018</span>
            <p>Learning to destroy demons won’t be easy, and Tanjiro barely knows where to start. The surprise
              appearance of another boy named Giyu, who seems to know what’s going on, might provide some answers—but
              only if Tanjiro can stop Giyu from killing his sister first!</p>
            <p>"Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of the best anime airing this season, for its gorgeous animation,
              emotionally-gripping story and interesting characters. All of these elements combined make for a great
              series, and also make it recognizable as one of the best shounen anime we have seen this year!"</p>

            <p>Middle school student Izuku Midoriya wants to be a hero more than anything, but he hasn’t got an ounce
              of power in him. With no chance of ever getting into the prestigious U.A. High School for budding heroes,
              his life is looking more and more like a dead end. Then an encounter with All Might, the greatest hero of
              them all, gives him a chance to change his destiny…</p>
            <p>"Boku No Hero Academia takes inspiration from most of these tropes, and makes it into something worth
              watching. The main character Izuku Midoriya is in fact, quite similar to other shonen leads, but his
              growth is so well explored it keeps you interested.

              And the story isn't just about the protagonist, it's about everyone around him, about the world of
              villains and heroes at large. A world where a wannabe hero kid's brash decisions can have dire
              consequences."</p>

            <p>Every time a promising villain appears, Saitama beats the snot out of ’em with one punch! Can he finally
              find an opponent who can go toe-to-toe with him and give his life some meaning? Or is he doomed to a life
              of superpowered boredom?</p>
            <p>"One Punch Man. An absolute gem of an anime and, I’m sure, of a manga, too–though I think I’ll just wait
              for the next season. With nuanced character development, badass, over-the-top action sequences, and enough
              humor to keep it honest, there’s so much to learn from the writing and to enjoy about the show’s fresh,
              expectation-defying take on the superhero genre."</p>

            <h2>Roronoa Zoro</h2>
            <p>Roronoa Zoro, nicknamed "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a fictional character in the One Piece franchise created
              by Eiichiro Oda. In the story, Pirate Hunter Zoro is the first to join Monkey D. Luffy after he is saved
              from being executed at the Marine Base.</p>
            <p>"Even after being told he couldn't survive it, he was still willing to take it in in exchange for Luffy's
              life. That means he considered Luffy's dream to be more important to him than his own. When he survived,
              he didn't want any recognition for it, or for anyone to feel indebted to him. That's why Zoro is the
              best.""

            <h2>Lelouch Lamperouge</h2>
            <p>Lelouch vi Britannia, whose alias is Lelouch Lamperouge, is the title character and leading antihero of
              the Sunrise anime series Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. In the series, Lelouch is a former prince
              from the superpower Britannia who is given the power of the "Geass" by a witch known as C.C.</p>
            <p>"I for one find him such a fascinating character. Sometimes he acts quite sinister, he does laugh in a
              crazy way like Light Yagami from Death Note. But there is a massive difference between the two, and why I
              could watch Code Geass but couldn't get into Death Note."</p>
