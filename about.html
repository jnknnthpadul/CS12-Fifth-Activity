                    <p>Reasons not to like anime</p>
                </div>
                <p>Anime is just the perfect thing for those, who are fascinated with animation which narrate
                    amazing storylines. The visuals leave an impact hard enough to make you re-watch it. Anime is
                    like a dreamland, carrying great stories with a rainbow of emotions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Storylines- Plots and storylines are amazing beyond words. They literally widen your brain’s
                        imaginative domain. Anime provides a look into the human heart in this way. This is also the
                        reason anime be it an anime film or anime series often brings tears and even profound
                        reflection to a viewer. It forces you to confront topics and ask questions.</li>
                    <li>Animation- Honestly, I think anime is a form of entertainment with the perfect graphics.
                        Animation allows creators to tell more fantastic stories visually.</li>
                    <li>Characters and Character Development- One of the most interesting thing about the anime
                        industry is, the depth of characterization. The circumstances would make you feel their
                        emotions as if they were real. Moreover, the character development that a character goes
                        through as the series progress is remarkable. You will come to know the backstories, the
                        hardships that made the character the way it used to be.</li>
                    <li>Soundtracks- The background music, OP, ED, etc. paints the anime in a new color. They light
                        up the moment, intense the moment, or makes everything depressing, all according to the
                        plot, which makes the anime more enjoyable. The music is so beautiful that it would play
                        your heart like an instrument, and when you get to know the meaning of the lyrics its more
                        gorgeous.</li>
                    <li>Intense Battles- The fight scenes are on whole another level.</li>
                    <li>Portrayed Topics- Various topics are portrayed in anime that the society doesn't accept or
                        doesn't give much ear to, like- LGBTQ, depression, social anxiety, love issues, PTSD,
                        bullying, etc. Topics like these are brought to light and discussed vastly.</li>
                    <li>Motivation and Quotes- The best anime in the world take you to a whole other universe
                        altogether. It gives teachings about friendship, coping up with sadness, winning against all
                        odds, and giving fresh perspectives to your world view. They don't always blabber about the
                        lines of justice and the narrow righteous path. They tell that sometimes, its okay to break
                        the rules.</li>
                    <li>Voice Actors and Actresses- They are a vital part of the anime industry. The way in which
                        they show their expressions through their voice is just amazing. I really find it impressive
                        how they convey the right amount of emotions in the right direction.</li>
                    <li>Something to learn- There's always something to learn from every anime. It doesn’t matter if
                        it’s a comedy series, or a simple “slice of life”. There’s always something to take from it.
                        Whether it’s comical, creative, a dark truth about life, or something else.</li>
